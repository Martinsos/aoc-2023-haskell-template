  -- This causes cabal to build modules (of local packages, which is aoc2023 in our case) on all cores,
  -- instead of just one, therefore reducing our build times.
  ghc-options: -j

-- This causes cabal to build packages on all cores, instead of just one.
-- This doesn't help when developing a single local package, but instead helps when
-- building multiple packages at once, for example external dependencies.
jobs: $ncpus

-- Ensures that tests print their output to stdout as they execute.
